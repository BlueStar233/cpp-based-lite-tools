# tic-tac-toe-simple-game
A rather simple C++ game so there's no need for a license.

# Descriptions
Contains only a .cpp file. Available after being complied in Windows environment 

I got it completed when being in no mood for working on algorithm learning around a year ago.

Simple, yes, but available. It's uploaded mainly because it will look better if there's at least

one repository in your main page , isn't it.

One of the drawbacks is to have a poor random algorithm for the robot. Another is that some codes 

are useless and surplus.

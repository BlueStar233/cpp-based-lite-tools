# includes

#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
```

# Descriptions
Contains only a .cpp file. Available after being complied. 

I got it completed when being in no mood for working on algorithm learning around a year ago.

Simple, yes, but available. It's uploaded mainly because it will look better if there's at least

one repository in your main page , right?

One of the drawbacks is to have a poor random algorithm of the robot. Another is that some codes 

are useless and surplus.
